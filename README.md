Project Desciption: We made a traffic simulator using open street map. That looks like real world. The main feature is that the traffic can run artifitially as real world. For making this software first we tried sumo to make simulation. The sumo configuration files and related files and osm file that we used are given in this repository. Then we use this concept in unity and make a real world simulation. In this simulation user can control camera by A,S,D,W key and can be able to survive all the area of simulation land. So, our project has two part. One is simulation in sumo using a real world map and other is making a simulation software using unity 3d. First one is given in this repository and other one is in the following link. Thank you.
